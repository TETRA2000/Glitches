## About

This mini game was made for Game Off 2021.

There are a few "bugs" on this game. They make it a bit harder for you to play.

If you took items(which looks like potions), you'll moved unintentionally or your guns will be disable for a little moment.

## How to play

- Move: WASD or arrow keys
- Fire: SPACE key
